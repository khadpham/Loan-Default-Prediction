## Data Cleaning

The initial dataset was inspected for duplicates and constant columns. The following steps were taken:

1. **Duplicates**: Checked for and removed any duplicate rows.
2. **Constant Columns**: Removed columns with a single unique value to reduce dimensionality.

## Descriptive Statistics & Data Visualization

The dataset's characteristics and distributions were explored using various charts:

1. **Loan Amount**: A histogram was plotted to observe the distribution. Most loans were found to be in the range of $5,000 to $20,000.
2. **Interest Rate**: A histogram showcased the majority of loans having an interest rate between 9% and 15%.
3. **Grade**: A bar plot depicted the count of loans by grade, revealing a skewed distribution with certain grades being more frequent.
4. **Loan Amount by Grade**: A box plot showed the spread of loan amounts across different grades.

## Correlation Analysis

A heatmap was used to visualize correlations:

- **Strong Positive Correlations**: Variables like "Funded Amount" and "Loan Amount" exhibited strong positive correlations.
- **Other Correlations**: Some other variables also showed significant correlations, providing insights into potential multicollinearity.

## Multivariate Analysis

Relationships between multiple variables were explored:

- A scatter plot of "Loan Amount" vs. "Interest Rate" was drawn, with colors indicating different "Grades". This visual helped discern patterns and relationships between the three variables.
