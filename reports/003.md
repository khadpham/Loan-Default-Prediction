## Data Preprocessing

### Formatting

Initial inspection of the dataset ensured consistent formatting. Specifically:
- 'Grade' and 'Sub Grade' columns were consistently formatted.
- 'Loan Title' had variations representing similar information (e.g., "Debt Consolidation" vs. "Debt consolidation").

### Encoding

Categorical variables were transformed to numerical formats:
- One-hot encoding was applied to columns with few unique values, generating binary columns.
- Ordinal encoding was used for 'Grade' and 'Sub Grade' due to their inherent order.

### Imputing

No missing values were detected in the dataset, negating the need for imputation.

### Sampling

The full dataset was retained for comprehensive exploration without sampling.

### Splitting

Data splitting into training, validation, and test sets will be considered during modeling phases.

## Data Transformation

### Scaling

Numerical features were previously scaled using the StandardScaler, resulting in a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for these features.

### Normalizing

Logarithmic transformations were applied to certain columns exhibiting positive skewness to achieve more symmetric distributions.

### Discretizing

The 'Loan Amount' column was discretized into three categories: 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High', dividing the dataset approximately equally.

### Combining

No combining methods like PCA were applied at this stage.
