# Data Exploration and Preprocessing Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the steps taken for data exploration and preprocessing on a given dataset. The process aims to ensure data quality and relevance for subsequent analyses or modeling.

- [Outlier Detection](#outlier-detection)
- [Feature Removal](#feature-removal)
- [Correlation Analysis](#correlation-analysis)

## Initial Data Exploration

The dataset was loaded into a pandas dataframe, and the initial exploration was conducted. This included:
- Checking the data's shape and size.
- Viewing the initial rows for a preliminary understanding.
- Computing descriptive statistics for numerical variables.
- Computing frequency counts for categorical variables.

## Outlier Detection

Three methods were initially considered for outlier detection: Z-score, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Due to memory constraints, only the Z-score and Isolation Forest methods were used.

**Findings**:
- **Z-score**: Detected a significant number of outliers.
- **Isolation Forest**: Detected 3,374 outliers. This method was chosen for outlier removal.

## Feature Removal

Several columns were removed due to being deemed unimportant or redundant:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for each entry.
- **Batch Enrolled**: Removed upon request.
- **Accounts Delinquent**: Removed upon request.
- **Payment Plan**: Had a single unique value and was removed.

## Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix was computed, and a heatmap was generated to visualize the relationships between the numerical variables. This helped in understanding potential multicollinearity and the strength of relationships between different variables.

# Detailed Data Exploration and Preprocessing Report

## Overview

This report provides an in-depth view of the data exploration and preprocessing steps undertaken on the dataset. The dataset underwent several cleaning, preprocessing, and exploration steps to ensure its readiness for modeling or further analysis.

- [Multivariate Analysis](#multivariate-analysis)

## Data Cleaning

The initial dataset was inspected for duplicates and constant columns. The following steps were taken:

1. **Duplicates**: Checked for and removed any duplicate rows.
2. **Constant Columns**: Removed columns with a single unique value to reduce dimensionality.

## Descriptive Statistics & Data Visualization

The dataset's characteristics and distributions were explored using various charts:

1. **Loan Amount**: A histogram was plotted to observe the distribution. Most loans were found to be in the range of $5,000 to $20,000.
2. **Interest Rate**: A histogram showcased the majority of loans having an interest rate between 9% and 15%.
3. **Grade**: A bar plot depicted the count of loans by grade, revealing a skewed distribution with certain grades being more frequent.
4. **Loan Amount by Grade**: A box plot showed the spread of loan amounts across different grades.

## Correlation Analysis

A heatmap was used to visualize correlations:

- **Strong Positive Correlations**: Variables like "Funded Amount" and "Loan Amount" exhibited strong positive correlations.
- **Other Correlations**: Some other variables also showed significant correlations, providing insights into potential multicollinearity.

## Multivariate Analysis

Relationships between multiple variables were explored:

- A scatter plot of "Loan Amount" vs. "Interest Rate" was drawn, with colors indicating different "Grades". This visual helped discern patterns and relationships between the three variables.
