# Data Exploration and Preprocessing Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the steps taken for data exploration and preprocessing on a given dataset. The process aims to ensure data quality and relevance for subsequent analyses or modeling.

## Initial Data Exploration

The dataset was loaded into a pandas dataframe, and the initial exploration was conducted. This included:
- Checking the data's shape and size.
- Viewing the initial rows for a preliminary understanding.
- Computing descriptive statistics for numerical variables.
- Computing frequency counts for categorical variables.

## Outlier Detection

Three methods were initially considered for outlier detection: Z-score, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Due to memory constraints, only the Z-score and Isolation Forest methods were used.

**Findings**:
- **Z-score**: Detected a significant number of outliers.
- **Isolation Forest**: Detected 3,374 outliers. This method was chosen for outlier removal.

## Feature Removal

Several columns were removed due to being deemed unimportant or redundant:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for each entry.
- **Batch Enrolled**: Removed upon request.
- **Accounts Delinquent**: Removed upon request.
- **Payment Plan**: Had a single unique value and was removed.

## Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix was computed, and a heatmap was generated to visualize the relationships between the numerical variables. This helped in understanding potential multicollinearity and the strength of relationships between different variables.
